description: Setup a local development environment using Nix on Linux

<Callout type="error">
  Currently, Pterodactyl Wings has compatibility issues with the NixOS
  development environment. This limitation is temporary and will be addressed in
  future updates.
</Callout>

This approach offers several advantages:

- Faster boot times without VM overhead
- Lower resource consumption
- Flexible configuration through `nix/buildsteps.sh`
- Improved reliability across Linux distributions

### Prerequisites for Nix Setup

- Nix Package Manager
- NodeJS (latest LTS version)
- pnpm
- Docker Engine
- Git

### Getting Started with Nix

1. Install Nix and enable flakes support (configuration varies by distribution)

2. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

4. Build the application:

   ```bash
   pnpm run ship
   ```

   This step:

   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Subsequent builds are much faster if code hasn't changed

5. Create environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.nix .env
   ```

6. Initialize development environment:
   ```bash
   nix run
   ```

### Nix Setup Process

The initialization process is completely automated:

- Sets up Wings and required services
- Configures databases and application
- Takes approximately 15 minutes

Once you see "Pyrodactyl is now up and running at localhost:8000", access the application and login using the credentials shown in your console.

  Always use localhost:8000, not 127.0.0.1, to avoid CORS issues!
</Callout>

Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin` to create your first server.
