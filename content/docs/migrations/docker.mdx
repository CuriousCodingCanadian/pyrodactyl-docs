<Callout type="info">
  For Pyrodactyl-specific issues, please use [Pyrodactyl GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/discussions) instead of Pterodactyl or Pelican support channels.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Always make sure you take a backup of your Pterodactyl database and other relevant data.
</Callout>

If you already have Pterodactyl running in Docker, simply update your panel image in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```diff
-image: ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
+image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Swapping between Pyrodactyl and Pterodactyl is unsupported and can cause data loss. Pyrodactyl makes changes to the database schema, meaning Pterodactyl will **not** function correctly. If you want to go back to Pterodactyl, you will need to restore your database from a backup made pre-migration.
