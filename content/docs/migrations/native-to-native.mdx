## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native â†’ Native)

<Callout type="warn">
  Before making any changes, back up your entire panel directory and database. Pyrodactyl modifies the database schema, and rolling back to Pterodactyl may result in data loss or instability.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

- Root or sudo access on your Linux server  
- Latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed  
- Composer installed globally  
- MySQL database access and credentials  
- Backup of `.env` and your current database  

### Migration Steps

Let's begin by installing a Node version manager and setting up the correct Node version:

```bash
curl -o- https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

Once that's done, restart your shell or follow the on-screen setup instructions, then install Node 22:

```bash
fnm install 22
```

Now navigate to the directory where your current Pterodactyl panel is installed:

```bash
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
```

Put the panel into maintenance mode:

```bash
php artisan down
```

Download and extract the latest Pyrodactyl release:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | tar -xzv
```

Set proper permissions:

```bash
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

Clear cached views and configuration:

```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

Run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

Set ownership to the web server user:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pterodactyl/*
```

Restart the queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:restart
```

Build the frontend assets:

```bash
npm ci && npm run ship
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

Bring the panel back online:

```bash
php artisan up
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Boom! Your panel is now migrated to Pyrodactyl!**
