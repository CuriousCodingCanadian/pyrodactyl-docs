# Local Development

There are three ways to set up a local development environment for Pyrodactyl:
- Using Nix on Linux (recommended for faster performance)
- Using Vagrant on Linux (traditional VM-based approach)
- Using Vagrant on Windows (first Pterodactyl panel with Windows development support)

## Local Dev with Nix

This approach offers several advantages:
- Faster boot times without VM overhead
- Lower resource consumption
- Flexible configuration through nix/buildsteps.sh
- Improved reliability across Linux distributions

### Prerequisites for Nix Setup

- Nix Package Manager
- NodeJS (latest LTS version)
- Docker Engine
- Git

### Getting Started with Nix

1. Install Nix and enable flakes support (configuration varies by distribution)

2. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run ship
   ```
   This step:
   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Subsequent builds are much faster if code hasn't changed

5. Create environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.nix .env
   ```

6. Initialize development environment:
   ```bash
   nix run
   ```

### Nix Setup Process

The initialization process is completely automated:
- Sets up Wings and required services
- Configures databases and application
- Takes approximately 15 minutes

Once you see "Pyrodactyl is now up and running at localhost:8000", access the application and login using the credentials shown in your console.

<Callout type="warn">
    Always use localhost:8000, not 127.0.0.1, to avoid CORS issues!
</Callout>

Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin` to create your first server.

### Known Issues with Nix

<Callout type="error">
  Currently, Pterodactyl Wings has compatibility issues with the NixOS development environment. This limitation is temporary and will be addressed in future updates.
</Callout>

## Local Dev with Vagrant on Linux

### Prerequisites for Vagrant Setup

- NodeJS (Latest LTS version)
- Git
- Vagrant
- libvirtd
- nfs-utils

### Installing NFS Utils

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install nfs-utils
```

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
```

Enable and start the NFS server:
```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start nfs-server

# Enable on boot
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server
```

### Development Setup with Vagrant

1. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run ship
   ```
   This step:
   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Subsequent builds without code changes are nearly instant

4. If using libvirt, install the vagrant-libvirt plugin

<Callout type="info">
Files must be in /var/www/pterodactyl for vagrant up to work, unless specified otherwise in Vagrantfile
</Callout>

5. Initialize the environment:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```
   This process:
   - Sets up wings and required services
   - Configures databases and applications
   - Takes approximately 15 minutes

6. Access Pyrodactyl at `localhost:3000` and login with the console-provided credentials

<Callout type="warn">
Always use localhost, not 127.0.0.1, to avoid CORS issues!
</Callout>

### Troubleshooting Vagrant Setup

#### VM Configuration
When using alternatives to libvirtd, modify the Vagrantfile to allocate more than the default 512MB RAM

#### NFS Mount Error
If you encounter a "Connection refused" error during first `vagrant up`, simply retry the command

#### Permission Issues
Run commands with sudo:
```bash
sudo vagrant up
```

## Local Dev with Vagrant on Windows

Pyrodactyl is the world's first Pterodactyl panel that can be developed and run locally (with Wings) on Windows machines through Vagrant.

### Prerequisites for Windows

- NodeJS (latest LTS version)
- Vagrant
- Git

### Installing on Windows

1. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run ship
   ```
   This step:
   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Subsequent builds are much faster if code hasn't changed

4. Initialize the environment:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```
   This process:
   - Sets up Pterodactyl Wings and necessary services
   - Configures databases and applications
   - Takes approximately 15 minutes

5. Login using the credentials shown in your console

<Callout type="warn">
Always use localhost:8000, not 127.0.0.1, to avoid CORS issues!
</Callout>

6. Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin` to create your first server

### Development Notes

#### Development Server
- Running `npm run dev` serves a development build at localhost:3000 with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- For production preview:
  1. Stop the dev server
  2. Run `npm run ship`
  3. Access http://localhost:3000

#### Troubleshooting Connection Issues
- If localhost:3000 hangs indefinitely:
  1. Check for port conflicts with other applications (e.g., Steam using port 8080)
  2. After resolving conflicts, run `vagrant reload` to reset port mappings

#### VirtualBox Shared Folders
If encountering "Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders":
```bash
# Install vbguest plugin
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

# For existing installations, update with:
vagrant plugin update vagrant-vbguest
```

#### Performance Tips
- Set up Remote Caching via Turbo for faster builds
- Cached results allow production server builds to complete in milliseconds

#### Virtualization Notes
<Callout type="error">
Avoid Hyper-V as your virtualization layer
</Callout>

- Recommended: VMWare Workstation or VirtualBox
- If prompted for password with Hyper-V, use your Windows credentials
