### Prerequisites

- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Basic Docker and system administration skills
- Docker auto-start enabled

<Callout type="warn">
   Do not use Snap-based Docker installations!
</Callout>

## Installation

1. Create a new directory for your Pyrodactyl installation. This will be the root directory for your Docker containers and configuration files.

   ```bash
   cd /opt
   mkdir -p pyrodactyl && cd pyrodactyl
   ```

2. Download and configure the Docker Compose [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml).
   - `x-common` has a set of placeholder values. These values need to be replaced with the corresponding values for your setup.
   - To use Pyrodactyl with a reverse proxy, you need to change the ports under the `panel` section.
      - These ports are in the format `host-port:container-port`. Changing the container port is not supported.
   
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml
   nano docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Start Pyrodactyl using Docker Compose.

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Create an admin user for the panel.

   ```bash
   docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
   ```

## Panel Configuration

1. Log into the panel using the user you created in the previous step.
2. Navigate to the Admin Panel.
   - Click on the three dots at the top of the left sidebar, then choose "Admin Panel". 
3. Create a new location.

## Wings Installation

In addition to the Pyrodactyl panel, you'll need Pterodactyl Wings as a backend for your servers. This guide only covers installing one Wings instance, but you can repeat it as many times as needed.

1. Create a new directory for Wings.
   ```bash
   cd /opt
   mkdir -p wings && cd wings
   ```

2. Download the Dcoker Compose file.
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/raw/develop/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Start Wings using Docker Compose.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. If applicable, allow Wings network access in your firewall:
   - If using `ufw`:
     ```bash
     ufw allow 2022/tcp
     ufw allow 8080/tcp
     ```
   - If using `iptables`:
     ```bash
     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2022 -j ACCEPT
     ```

## Node Configuration

Once you install Pyrodactyl, you'll need to set up a node to host your servers.

1. Log into the panel using the user you created in the first step (if you're not logged in already).

2. Create a new node.
   - Set the FQDN to the domain of the server you installed Wings on.
   - Under "Configuration", set the memory and disk space to the maximum you want to use for your servers.

3. Configure Wings on the node.
   - Navigate to the Configuration tab (on the left side).
   - Copy the Configuration File's contents to /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml on the server you installed Wings on.
   - Set the IP to the IP you want your servers to be accessible from. (Any domain or subdomain you want to use should point to this IP.)
   - Add allocations for the ports you want to be available for servers.
   - If you want to show a different IP in the UI (e.g. a subdomain), fill the Alias field with the IP you want to show.

## Post-Installation Steps

### Email Configuration

For features that use email, like password resets, you'll need an SFTP server. You can use any SFTP server, but we recommend using [Maddy](https://maddy.email).

You can configure SFTP settings by navigating to the Admin Panel, then Settings.

### DDoS protection

If you're planning to have your server publicly accessible, your server could be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. If this is a concern for you, consider using a DDoS protection service like [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/).
The goal is to not have your server's IP address on any known domain.

### Troubleshooting

If you can't connect to Pyrodactyl or Wings, you may need to allow their ports in your server's firewall.
- Pyrodactyl:
   - `ufw`:
      ```bash
      ufw allow 80/tcp
      ufw allow 443/tcp
      ```
   - `iptables`:
      ```bash
      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
      ```
- Wings:
   - `ufw`:
      ```bash
      ufw allow 2022/tcp
      ufw allow 8080/tcp
      ```
   - `iptables`:
      ```bash
      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2022 -j ACCEPT
      ```
